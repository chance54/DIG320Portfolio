Why "COC"???

The conveyor belt is something I started for another project I'm working on that's been brewing for a little over 2 years:

Convention of Creation (COC)

A thriller puzzle game that is a direct storylined sequel to my first ever published work: "Borwo's Funtime Park Thingy", which you can find on my itch.

That game in particular is less than impressive (unless you wanna factor in it was made in 4 hours from 12a-4a), and had really no rhyme or reason for why you were really there in the first place and how Borwo came to be.

Convention of Creation strives to answer that, while also posing more questions as to what's really going on.

If you actually read this, you're going to be one of the few people to know the games are connected until COC's initial release, and even then I'm not sure

the connections will be clear, you'll just have to wait for another installment.
