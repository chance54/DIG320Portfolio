## *Important Note: The blender file associated with the final Werehouse model is labled "Werehouse002" and not "Werehouse". Also, when making the project I utalized 4k.png texture images for most of the textures and unfortunately ran into issues uploading the files to github. So, I had to use gitbatch and along with the texture changes came the deletion of the `.psd` file mentioned below. All that to say as of currently the `.blend` file will not display correct textures for most of the elements in the scene, and you will have to manually set them in the shader blueprint window.*

# File Directory
### **BLENDER_ASSET_OBJECTS** -> The `.blend`, `.obj`, and `.mtl` files created from blender. You can open and edit the assets by opening the `.blend` file, and import the objects into a 3D enviornment with the `.obj` and `.mtl` files.
### **MAPS** -> The *color, normal, displacement, roughness, and metalness* maps of the various materials found in the werehouse, along with the `.psd` file to view and change them.
### **RENDER_IMAGES** -> Screenshots of blender showing the werehouse model in various views; Renders, Shaded, and Wireframe. The showcase image is `WEREHOUSE_RENDER_800SAMPLES.png`
### **TEXTURES** -> The various textures used in the werehouse. All textures can be found on AmbientCG.com under a Creative Commons 0 1.0 licence, making them apart of the public domain off release. The werehouse, and all it's assets, fall under the same licence.

## With that said, I hope you are able to enjoy my werehouse and even utalize it in your own work, I'd love to see what you make with it!
